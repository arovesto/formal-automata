# formal-automata
This is a code for telegram bot wich generate all kinds of automatas from regular expression.
This is are:
* NFA (not deterimned automata)
* DFA (determined automata)
* MinDFA (minimal determined automata)
* Regex parser

Overall complexity isn't that good, but for less then 100 characters regular expression it is worked rather fast
